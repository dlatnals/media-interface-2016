        WNYC’s data editor, John Keefe, attended one of Make: magazine’s Maker Faire events and took up a hobby of tinkering with electronics, he was looking for a way to combine WNYC’s participation culture with the emergent maker movement. In the early phase, when Keefe and his team were casting about for ideas, their rough concept involved distributing some kind of custom electronic sensor around a neighborhood, recording some data, and having it sent back to WNYC

         And although they knew their community was interested in electronics they didn’t have a hook to pull people in. Every seventeen years on the northeastern seaboard of the United States, when winter turns to spring and the temperature starts to rise, the local variety of cicadas (called magicicada) crawl out of the little holes where they’ve been hibernating. For residents near cicada breeding grounds the cicada months can mean weeks of a constant background drone.

       A good predictor of the cicadas’ arrival was soil temperature. When magicadas hit their adult year they emerge when dirt eight inches below ground reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit. The sensors could be placed in the communities’ backyards, producing data to predict when the cicadas would come out. WNYC would need to add a few customizations, but all the sensors could be made with easily accessible parts.
