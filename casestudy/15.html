          In hundreds of neighborhoods across the United States, children are living and playing near sites where factories once spewed lead and other toxic metal particles into the air. The factories, which melted lead in a process called smelting, closed long ago but poisonous lead particles can still be found in the soil nearby. Families interviewed were unaware of the dangers posed by their yards – and the government has done little to warn them, a USA TODAY investigation has found.

        Government regulators were warned a decade ago about more than 400 forgotten lead smelting firms that operated in the 1930s to 1960s and may have deposited dangerous levels of lead contamination in nearby soil. Yet the EPA and state officials have left families and children in harm's way, doing little to assess the danger around many sites, USA TODAY's 14-month investigation found.
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-4">
        In Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin, the EPA sent investigators to dozens of sites in 2004 to 2006 after they verified a lead smelter once operated there. The investigators recommended soil tests in the neighborhoods. Most of the tests have never been done. This yard is in a neighborhood near the former White Brothers Smelting site in Philadelphia that never received recommended testing. USA TODAY's tests showed potentially dangerous levels of lead in this yard and others.  
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-4">
          Trace amounts of lead – particles so tiny they're barely visible on toys or in the soil – are enough to cause irreversible health problems in children who ingest or inhale them over time. Swallowing just 6 micrograms of lead particles a day can raise a child's blood-lead level by up to 1 point – which in turn can result in the loss of up to 1 IQ point, according to California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.

          Tests by USA TODAY in neighborhoods near former lead factories showed dirt so contaminated that children shouldn't be playing in it. The soil tests revealed potentially dangerous lead levels in areas of all 21 neighborhoods examined in 13 states. Regulators in Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Wisconsin have taken actions as a result of the newspaper's tests even before this report was published. Children ages 6 and younger are at greatest risk from lead exposure because they are constantly putting things in their mouths. Kevin Marshall, 2, spent much of the summer playing in the backyard of his family's home in Philadelphia — until USA TODAY's tests found it was contaminated with lead. A blood test in August 2011 showed he had a worrisome amount of lead in his body.

         Tyroler Metals in Cleveland operated from about 1927 to 1957. Regulators investigating the forgotten smelter tested soil in 2003 and found high levels of lead indicating a possible fallout zone on a neighborhood. Yet they never told the people living nearby or ordered any cleanup, USA TODAY found. Smelting no longer occurs at the Tyroler site, which is now a scrap yard with a different owner.

        <br /> The state's soil tests found high levels of lead in this neighborhood and regulators said they "recognized there could be potential for a health concern." They sent their report to the U.S. EPA and Cleveland's health department in 2004. Neither agency took action. USA TODAY's recent tests found high levels of lead in families' yards. The EPA said it will now re-examine the area to see whether a cleanup evaluation is appropriate. When state regulators investigated the Tyroler Metals site on Sweeney Avenue, they discovered that other lead factories and smelters also had operated near the site as far back as 1912, records show. Because a specific source of the neighborhood's lead contamination couldn't be determined, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency said there was nothing more it could do.

          Soil around homes can be contaminated with lead, even if you don't live near an old factory site. Most people are aware of the dangers of deteriorating lead-based paint. Less understood is the danger posed by soil contaminated from old factories, chipping paint and the tons of lead dust spewed for decades from the tailpipes of vehicles burning leaded gasoline. Lead dust builds up in the top few inches of the soil. If left undisturbed, it can remain there for hundreds of years.

          1. Leave shoes at the door so contaminated soil isn't tracked into the house as dust. Make sure children wash their hands after playing – especially before having snacks. Wash toys regularly to reduce lead dust from accumulating on them.
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-3 text-center">
          2.Lead-based paint was widely used until the 1950s, and banned from residential use in 1978. Talk with your health department about how to test your home for lead. Report chipped or flaking paint to your landlord if you live in a home built before 1978. Don't let children chew on painted surfaces. Be aware that renovations can generate toxic lead dust if not done properly.
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-3 text-center">
          3.Over the years, wind and rain can deposit lead particles on the roofs and sides of homes. These particles eventually drop into soil below the home's dripline. This 3-foot-wide strip around the base of the house is one of the areas most likely to have contaminated soil, studies show. It may also contain lead from flaking paint. Don't plant vegetables or let children play in this area.
        </div>  
        
        <div class="col-md-3 text-center">
          4.Don't let children play in bare soil – assume it contains lead, especially if you live in a city. Make sure it has a thick cover of grass, mulch, wood chips or even a blanket to keep their hands from touching the soil. Keep the play area away from the side of buildings or fences with old paint. These areas also can accumulate wind-blown lead particles.
