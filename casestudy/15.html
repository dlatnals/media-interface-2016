          In hundreds of neighborhoods across the United States, children are living and playing near sites where factories once spewed lead and other toxic metal particles into the air. The factories, which melted lead in a process called smelting, closed long ago but poisonous lead particles can still be found in the soil nearby. Families interviewed were unaware of the dangers posed by their yards – and the government has done little to warn them, a USA TODAY investigation has found.

        Government regulators were warned a decade ago about more than 400 forgotten lead smelting firms that operated in the 1930s to 1960s and may have deposited dangerous levels of lead contamination in nearby soil. Yet the EPA and state officials have left families and children in harm's way, doing little to assess the danger around many sites, USA TODAY's 14-month investigation found.
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-4">
        In Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin, the EPA sent investigators to dozens of sites in 2004 to 2006 after they verified a lead smelter once operated there. The investigators recommended soil tests in the neighborhoods. Most of the tests have never been done. This yard is in a neighborhood near the former White Brothers Smelting site in Philadelphia that never received recommended testing. USA TODAY's tests showed potentially dangerous levels of lead in this yard and others.

        <div class="col-md-4">
          Trace amounts of lead – particles so tiny they're barely visible on toys or in the soil – are enough to cause irreversible health problems in children who ingest or inhale them over time. Swallowing just 6 micrograms of lead particles a day can raise a child's blood-lead level by up to 1 point – which in turn can result in the loss of up to 1 IQ point, according to California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.

          Tests by USA TODAY in neighborhoods near former lead factories showed dirt so contaminated that children shouldn't be playing in it. The soil tests revealed potentially dangerous lead levels in areas of all 21 neighborhoods examined in 13 states. Regulators in Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Wisconsin have taken actions as a result of the newspaper's tests even before this report was published. Children ages 6 and younger are at greatest risk from lead exposure because they are constantly putting things in their mouths. Kevin Marshall, 2, spent much of the summer playing in the backyard of his family's home in Philadelphia — until USA TODAY's tests found it was contaminated with lead. A blood test in August 2011 showed he had a worrisome amount of lead in his body.

          <br /> Kathleen Marshall holds her son, Kevin, 2, at the corner outside their home near two former smelter sites on Hedley Street in Philadelphia’s Bridesburg neighborhood. The Thos. F. Lukens Metal Co. used to manufacture lead across the street; White Brothers Smelting was a few blocks down the street.

        <br /> A backyard is important to the Marshall family’s five children, said their mother, Kathleen Marshall. USA TODAY’s tests found elevated levels of lead in the soil of this and other yards in the neighborhood.
