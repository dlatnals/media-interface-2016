				<h1 class="text-center">A PERSISTENT PROBLEM</h1>

<p>Child marriage persists across countries, fuelled by poverty, social and cultural norms. For many families, it is a perceived economic need – one less mouth to feed. Long-held beliefs and traditions based on gender inequality mean that becoming a wife and mother is often deemed a daughter’s only choice.</p>

				<div class="col-md-4">
						<h1 class="text-center">CHILD MARRIAGE FACTS</h1>
<ul>
<li>More than 700 million women alive today were married before their 18th birthday. That is the equivalent of 10% of the world&#8217;s population.</li>
<li>If there is no reduction in child marriage, an additional 1.2 billion girls will be married by 2050.</li>
<li>Some child brides are as young as eight or nine.</li>
<li>Most adolescent pregnancies (90%) take place within marriage.</li>
<li>Pregnancy and childbirth complications are among the leading causes of death in girls aged 15 to 19 in low- and middle-income countries.</li>
</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h1 class="text-center">COMPELLING REASONS TO ACT NOW</h1>

<p>Globally, the rates of child marriage are slowly declining. Growing commitments to address the issue, such as the inclusion of target 5.3 to end child, early and forced marriage in the Sustainable Development Goals, are encouraging. However, there are urgent reasons to double our efforts.</p>

                 <p>The complex mix of cultural and economic factors mean there is not a single, simple solution. But, through partnership, long-term programming and a willingness to learn from our successes and failures, we can end child marriage in a generation.</p>
