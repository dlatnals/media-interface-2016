				<h1 class="text-center"><font color="0a3d42">A PERSISTENT PROBLEM</font></h1>

<p>Child marriage persists across countries, fuelled by poverty, social and cultural norms. For many families, it is a perceived economic need – one less mouth to feed. Long-held beliefs and traditions based on gender inequality mean that becoming a wife and mother is often deemed a daughter’s only choice.</p>

						<h1 class="text-center"><font color="0a3d42">CHILD MARRIAGE FACTS</font></h1>
<ul>
<li>More than 700 million women alive today were married before their 18th birthday. That is the equivalent of 10% of the world&#8217;s population.</li>
<li>If there is no reduction in child marriage, an additional 1.2 billion girls will be married by 2050.</li>
<li>Some child brides are as young as eight or nine.</li>
<li>Most adolescent pregnancies (90%) take place within marriage.</li>
<li>Pregnancy and childbirth complications are among the leading causes of death in girls aged 15 to 19 in low- and middle-income countries.</li>
</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h1 class="text-center"><font color="0a3d42">COMPELLING REASONS TO ACT NOW</font></h1>

<p>Globally, the rates of child marriage are slowly declining. Growing commitments to address the issue, such as the inclusion of target 5.3 to end child, early and forced marriage in the Sustainable Development Goals, are encouraging. However, there are urgent reasons to double our efforts.</p>

			<p>“Girls who are married before their 18th birthdays are not only denied their childhood but are often socially isolated and subjected to violence, and limited opportunities for education and employment,” says Bruno Maes, UNICEF Representative in Chad.

Shot in Chad, the video reflects a reality that is common throughout several developing nations. The country’s high child marriage rate ranks third globally, with 68% of girls married as children.</p>
